# Pneumonia-Detection-using-InceptionV3

# Project Overview

This project classifies chest X-ray images as NORMAL or PNEUMONIA using InceptionV3, a deep learning model. The model is fine-tuned to enhance automated pneumonia detection from medical imaging, improving accuracy in diagnosing lung infections.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of chest X-ray images categorized into:

NORMAL ‚Äì Healthy lung X-rays.

PNEUMONIA ‚Äì X-rays showing signs of pneumonia.

# Dataset Distribution

Training Set: 5216 images

Validation Set: 16 images

Test Set: 624 images

# Preprocessing & Augmentation

Images resized to 224√ó224√ó3 (RGB format) for model compatibility.

Applied augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming.

Pixel values normalized to 0-1 range for stable training.

# Model Architecture

Base Model: InceptionV3 (pretrained on ImageNet).

Added Layers:

Global Average Pooling

Dense Layer (128 neurons, ReLU activation)

Dropout Layer (0.5)

# Fine-Tuning: Last 100 layers of InceptionV3 were unfrozen and retrained.

# Training & Evaluation

Optimizer: Adam (learning rate: 1e-5)

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

Early Stopping: Enabled (patience: 5 epochs)

Epochs: 20

# Training Results

Training Accuracy	     98.88%	 

Validation Accuracy     100%
  
# Test Results

Test Accuracy: 91.03%

Test Loss: 0.2280

# Sample Image Prediction

A test image was selected and processed.

The model correctly classified it as NORMAL, confirming its reliability.
